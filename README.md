# Acoustic Ray Tracing for Room Simulation (ARTRS)

This package utilizes ray tracing techniques to simulate the propagation of sounds in an environment. Intended for use in audio separation research, this module is designed to allow a number of sound sources and receivers to be placed into an environment with other objects they can interact with.

Currently, the module supports the acoustic equivalents of specular reflection and shadows only. Future iterations might support:
* Transmittance through an object
* Atmospheric sound attenuation
* Diffuse reflections
* UI support via Blender
